# Introduction to SQL

## Database

A database is nothing more than a set of related information. A Dictonary for example, is a database of words in alphabetical order along with their meaning , part of speech and in some cases their origin or etymology is also provided.

## Nonrelational Database Systems

Over the first decades of computerized database systems, data was stored and represented to users in various ways. For example in a _heirarchical database_ system, data is represented as one or more tree structures. Each node in the tree may have either zero or one parent and zero or many childrens. This is known as a single-parent hierarchy.

Another common methods is called network database system which exposes set of records and set of links that define relationships between different records.

## The Relational Model

In 1970, Dr. E. F. Codd of IBM's research laboratory published a paper titled “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks” that proposed that data be represented as sets of tables. Rather than using pointers to navigate between entries, redundant data is used to link records in different tables.

The number of columns that a table may contain might vary from server to server but it's usually quite large so we don't have to worry about this. Meanwhile the number of rows that a table can have is upto the physical limits of the drive than of database server limitations.

Each table in a relational database includes information that uniquely identifies a row in that table known as the _primary key_. This is usually an id in which is present in that table either manually created or automatically generated by the server. A primary key can also be a combination of two or more keys knows as a _compound key_. Some of the table include information used to navigate another table, this is the "redundant data". These columns are known as the _foreign keys_. It might seem wasteful to store the same data many times, but the relational model is quite clear on what redundant data may stored.
